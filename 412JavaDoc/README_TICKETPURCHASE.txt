Created a main menu to link all of the use cases.  Ticket purchasing is the first use case we implemented 
and only current working one.  Users can search for the type of tickets they want (single, three, or five person ticket). 
This was done using Rule-Builder. The user can also select the type of ticket they want and purchase as many as they would like. 
After purchasing tickets a successful message will be displayed.  The purchased tickets will be displayed after clicking the
 "show tickets" button.
