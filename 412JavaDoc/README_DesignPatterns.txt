Run my use case by right clicking the app.java file in the TicketPackage package and hitting "run file." 
 ResList is the abstract list and Floor2List, ParkLoungeList, WLClubList, and WalleyLandOGList implement this
 to provide the correct functionality for their specific class. After filling out the form and pressing submit a confirmation message
will be displayed in the console for the restaurant you selected.
