For this use case, we focused on the Ticket package. As such, only the Ticket package is complete at this stage in the development process. Users can see the available tickets at the park, sort them by "Single", "Three person", or "Five person" tickets easily 
with a search button and checkboxes, then click on the purchase button to add the tickets to their list. Once purchased, users can click the "Show Tickets" button to view
their tickets. The ticket package was important to finalize first, since the ticket framework might serve as the basis for restaurant reservations and will also serve as 
data to be provided to the daily planner.
